**Whispers of the Night**

In the stillness of the night so deep,  
Where shadows dance and secrets keep,  
A whisper winds through silent trees,  
A tale of dreams on a midnight breeze.

The moonlight bathes the world in silver hue,  
While stars above twinkle in the blue,  
And in this moment, calm and bright,  
The world sleeps in the arms of night.
