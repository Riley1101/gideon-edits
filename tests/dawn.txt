**Echoes of Dawn**

As dawn breaks with a gentle sigh,  
Painting colors across the sky,  
The world awakes to greet the day,  
With whispers of light that softly play.

Birds sing out with morning cheer,  
Chasing away the nightâ€™s last tear,  
And in this moment, pure and new,  
The world is born in a golden hue.
